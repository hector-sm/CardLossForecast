    "#### Descriptive statistics\n",
    "- Descriptive statistics measures central tendency, dispersion and distribution of data using statistical techniques.\n",
    "- Central tendency: Mean, median, mode.\n",
    "- Dispersion: Range, standard deviation, variance, Gini coefficient.\n",
    "- Distribution: Statistical distribution is a mathematical function used to describe/calculate the probability of occurance of an observation in the sample and how frequently it occurs.\n",
    "#### Hypotehsis testing\n",
    "- Examination of a claim against accepted facts (called \"null hypothesis\"). Uses sample data to verify the claim about the whole population.\n",
    "- Test to verify the validity of a claim:\n",
    "    - t-test\n",
    "    - ANOVA\n",
    "    - Chi-squared\n",
    "- Additional concepts in hypothesis testing:\n",
    "    - p-value: In statistical terms, p=0.01 means there is a 1% probability that the result is due to chance.\n",
    "    - confidence intervals (CI): a measure of the degree of uncertainity.\n",
    "#### Regression\n",
    "- Linear models\n",
    "- Panel data models\n",
    "- Count data models\n",
    "- Binary outcome models\n",
    "- Generalized linear models\n",
    "#### Forecasting\n",
    "- Benchmark forecasting: They help build forecasting intuition upon which to add additional layers of complexity. Some techniques in benchmark forecasting are: Naive, Seasonal, Mean, Seasonal naive, Drift, Linear trend, Random walk and Geometric random walk"
